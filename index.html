				In a world plagued by individualism and toxic competitivity, I wondered to myself: Is there any hope of redefining our priorities and escaping from unsustainable economic growth? Can we find new Gods then those of profit and efficiency? Their must be other ways for humanity to thrive. Struggling to find opportunities for meaningful work combined with financial security, I look for answers on how to live and practice design differently. On this quest, traveling through time and realities, talking to different knowledgeable sources, I do see a beacon of light, several of them actually. They seemed so far away at first, almost out of grasp, but maybe they aren’t as unreachable as they look. I decided to share some of the conversations I’ve had along the way. All of the discussions that follow are true as I recall them, except for the parts I invented.

					<h2>Thomas</h2>

					<p>
						...Haven’t danced my ass off like this in ages, it was amazing. Can’t wait for the next one.
					</p>

					<p>
						Hm yeah, it was fun. I’m glad it wasn’t shut down by the police. It’s harder and harder to find real raves these days.
					</p>

					<p>
						What do you mean by real rave?
					</p>

					<p>
						A rave has to be an illegal party. Usually organized in abbandonned or rural areas. It started in Berlin, after the fall of the wall and coinciding with the rise of techno music, a lot of unclaimed buldings were used for raves. Some of
						these places are famous clubs today like Tresor. In the UK, which is my scene, raves happened with the Acid House movement. These temporary spaces, occupied without asking for permission are a beackon of freedom where almost everything is
						allowed. You can dress as you like, dance in the weirdest way and take whatever drugs you want, nobody will stop or judge you here. Openness towards drug use creates an environment of acceptance that many never experienced.
					</p>

					<p>
						I really like these ideas of inclusivity and tolerance. Speaking about the UK party scene brings me back to my teenage years and Sound System culture. This electronic reggea music makes me nostalgic and the movement has intresting values.
						To be recognized by your peers, it is basically mandatory to have your own music label. Anyone trying to make it in this music culture will not be accepted if they go through a big music publishing house. The sound system itself is a wall
						made from stacked speakers that are usually custom made artisannally. During illegal parties, dancers would surround the speakers and other sound equipement to stop the police from seezing it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Uniting to protect the artists, how cool! Nowadays people just run away if police shows up. It shows they cared about each other and weren’t afraid to fight for what they beleived.
					</p>

					<p>
						For sure! On top of that, building their own equipment is a form of autonomy and producing themselves makes them independant from big companies...
					</p>

					<h2>Nico</h2>

					<p>
						...Amazing dahl Nico, it was delicious. It’s nice being back here but I can’t help feeling a bit sad everytime I come back and remember this is the last squat in Geneva.
					</p>

					<p>
						I know man, these used to be proliferating around the city. Using buldings that are kept empty for real estate speculation and allowing people like me with little to no income to have a roof to live under. Most of them got shut down
						because they nest artists and activits that spread ‘evil’ antiestablishment ideas. And young people don’t know how to take over a building anymore, this knowledge is getting lost.
					</p>

					<p>
						That and the fact that in a lot of minds, these housing situations are linked to the heroin epidemic of the end of the 20th century. They were the only place addicts felt safe and accepted.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yeah, I know, I live with some here and it’s not always easy. I do wonder, if drug use had been decriminalized like it is in Portugal, where users don’t have to hide from oppressive law-enforcementand and can seek help if they want it,
						would there be more squats today? I’m not blaming them, just wondering.
					</p>

					<p>
						So how have you managed to not get kicked out from here, you’re so close to the city center?
					</p>

					<p>
						The simple answer is we don’t let police in, under any circumstance. On top of that, we host events like art exhibitions, performances and concerts serving drinks and sometimes food. This allows us to generate enough income to buy food
						and pay for utilities.
					</p>

					<p>
						Speaking of, how much do I owe you for the food?
					</p>

					<p>
						As always, there’s no fixed price, everyone pays what they can. I got to hold the bar for a few hours, see you later, good luck for the ping pong tournament...

					<h2>Yannik</h2>

					<p>
						...Well, here we are, you’re the last woofer of the season. Shall we have one last beer on the terrace before bed?
					</p>

					<p>
						Sounds good. It’s crazy to think we were 15 less than a month ago, the house is so empty now. I’ve had a lot of time to ponder while working the land you know. I really dig what you are building here, producing as much of you’re own food
						as possible, canning and pickling for the winter. This thrive for autonomy you have is really insipring. Do you think you’ll get there eventually, I mean to a place where you produce everything you need?
					</p>

					<p>
						Realisticly, no. There’s a lot of stuff we still buy like pasta, rice or toilet paper. We also need trucks to drive to markets. Ideally we wouldn’t use any money, most of the fights we have here are because of pricing and sales. But few
						people are intrested in barter so we have to make some money to buy what we do need. And, unfortunately, we rely on unpaid labour like you.
					</p>

					<p>
						I do like it here, even though it’s hard work, it feels like I’m doing something sensible...

					<h2>Robert</h2>

					<p>
						...The line seems properly rigged, make sure you double check everything before walking it though.
					</p>

					<p>
						I’ll wait till I’ve digested a bit more before I go on.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yeah, you don’t want to get leash whipped on a full stomach.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yesterday, I was listening to this podcast about libraries. They were explaining their history, how they’ve existed all over the world as places to store and share knowledge. But, if the idea was introduced today, it would seem absurd.
						Having a building and paying people so others can borrow things for free would be seen as just a waste of money no generating any profit. Isn’t this capitalist mentallity sad? Anyways, it made me think of this library of objects you’ve
						sarted. How’s it coming along?
					</p>

					<p>
						Better than expected actually. The principle behind it is ‘property of use’, you only own something as long as you are using it and then it goes back to the collectivity. These ideas are a bit too communist sounding, so we put other
						aspects forward. What we publicize mostly is the environmental benefit of not having to produce and individually own things we don’t use everyday like hand drills or big speakers for events. We’ve managed to get funding from local
						government, people are joining us and donating faster than we can keep the website up to date.
					</p>

					<p>
						Amazing, hopefully you don’t get swallowed by the greed machine. What we see happening with the internet, designed to share information but is now being restricted with subscriptions and pay walls everywhere. At least I can still pirate
						music, shows and software for now. Copyright and patents are so annoying, just slowing sharing of knowledge for profit. I get that I should be happy my work is protected as a visual maker but if you don’t have money for lawyers there’s
						not much you can do against corporations anyways.
					</p>

					<p>
						Do you know the Creative Cmmons organization? You can licence your work there and it can be used by others to build upon. You can chose if you want credit, that it should be also licensed there and if it’s only for non-profit use.
					</p>

					<p>
						Defenetly something I’ll look into. Time to walk this highline now, can you check my knots...
